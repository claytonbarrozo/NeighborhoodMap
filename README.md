# NeighborhoodMap
Map of my neighborhood built with Google maps API, Yelp API, and KnockoutJS. To use it, open the page in your browser. For larger viewports, you'll see a sidebar with the titles of the places, and for smaller viewports, this is replaced by a clickable menu icon to call up that sidebar. Check out the Yelp stars for each restaurant, bar, or bike enterprise.
