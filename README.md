# NeighborhoodMap
Map of my neighborhood built with Google maps API, Yelp API, and KnockoutJS. To use it, go to https://topplethepat.github.io/NeighborhoodMap/ & make sure to use the filter option I worked so hard on. Also, make sure to thoroughly enjoy the styles I created for it so it would look distinctive! For larger viewports, you'll see a sidebar with the titles of the places, and for smaller viewports, this is replaced by a clickable menu icon to call up that sidebar. Check out the Yelp stars in the infowindows for each restaurant, bar, or bike enterprise.
